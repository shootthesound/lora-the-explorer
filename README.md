This tool provides various FLUX LoRA manipulation techniques including subtraction, merging, layer targeting, and analysis. It's designed to help you create compatible LoRAs and experiment with different combination approaches.

## What You Can Do:

- **LoRA Subtraction**: Remove conflicts between LoRAs
- **Traditional Merging**: Combine LoRAs with custom weights (auto-detects incompatibilities)
- **Layer-Based Merging**: Surgically combine specific layers from different LoRAs
- **Layer Targeting**: Selectively mute facial or style layers
- **LoRA MetaEditor**: Direct metadata editing for any LoRA file
- **LoRA MetaViewer**: Examine LoRA characteristics, metadata, and compatibility
- **LoRA MetaEditor**: Direct metadata editing for fixing and customizing LoRAs
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with LoRAs from any training tool (AI-Toolkit, FluxGym, sd-scripts)
- **Automatic Fixes**: Auto-detects and resolves common compatibility issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shootthesound/lora-the-explorer.git
cd lora-the-explorer

# Run the installer
python install.py

or

Double click on windows_install.bat
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Create a Python virtual environment
- ‚úÖ Download and set up sd-scripts (sd3 branch with Flux support, pinned to stable commit)
- ‚úÖ Apply compatibility fixes for FLUX LoRA metadata
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies
- ‚úÖ Create launcher scripts

### Quick Launch
```bash
# Windows: Double-click start_gui.bat
# Unix/macOS: ./start_gui.sh
# Or manually:
python lora_algebra_gui.py
```

## üéÆ Getting Started

1. **Set up paths**: Use the "LoRA Paths" tab to scan your LoRA directory for autocomplete, and choose your default save directory
2. **Experiment**: Try different operations - each tab has usage guides and presets
3. **Start simple**: Begin with basic merging or subtraction or trying advanced layer techniques. My tip is to find a great style lora and merge a character into it with face layers.

## üéØ Key Features

### LoRA Subtraction
Remove unwanted influences from LoRAs:
```
Style_LoRA - Character_LoRA = Clean_Style_LoRA
```
Perfect for removing face changes from style LoRAs and creating character-neutral styles.

### Layer Targeting (FLUX)
Selectively mute specific layers in FLUX LoRAs:
- **Facial Layers (7,12,16,20)**: Remove face details while keeping style/costume
- **Aggressive Mode**: Maximum facial identity removal
- **Custom Selection**: Choose any combination of available layers

Perfect for extracting character costumes without faces (like Gandalf costume without Ian McKellen's face).

### Layer-Based Merging
Surgically combine layers from different LoRAs:
- **Face A + Style B**: Facial layers from character LoRA, style from artistic LoRA
- **Facial Priority**: All potential facial layers from one LoRA
- **Complement Split**: Early layers from one LoRA, late layers from another
- **Fix Overtrained LoRAs**: Replace problematic layers with clean ones

### LoRA MetaViewer & Analysis
Technical validation and metadata viewing:
- Check rank, alpha, base model compatibility
- Predict potential conflicts and suggest optimal strengths
- Browse and analyze existing LoRAs
- View complete LoRA metadata in readable format
- Double-click file selection from analysis results

*Note: This analysis is a guide to catch common technical issues only. It checks: rank differences, alpha mismatches, base model compatibility, and training efficiency.*

### Path Management
Streamlined workflow:
- Recursive LoRA directory scanning with autocomplete for all path inputs
- Default output directory settings that persist across sessions
- Double-click file selection in analysis results

### Universal Compatibility
Automatic fixes for cross-tool compatibility:
- **Auto-detects incompatible LoRAs** and enables concat mode when needed
- **Fixes FLUX metadata issues** (networks.lora ‚Üí networks.lora_flux) automatically
- **Handles mixed-dimension LoRAs** from layer merging operations
- **Works with any training tool**: AI-Toolkit, FluxGym, sd-scripts, kohya-ss
- **Enhanced error messages** with helpful suggestions when edge cases occur

### LoRA MetaEditor
Direct metadata editing with full control:
- **Edit any metadata field** in raw JSON format
- **Fix common issues**: Wrong network modules, incorrect base models, missing fields
- **In-place editing**: Modifies original file (ensure you have backups!)
- **Full user responsibility**: No safety nets - edit at your own risk
- **Universal metadata repair** for LoRAs from any source
- **Cross-tool compatibility fixes**: Repair LoRAs from different training tools
- **Custom metadata management**: Add training details, tags, or remove sensitive info

## üí° Use Cases

### Style LoRA Cleaning
Use the LoRA Subtraction tab to remove face changes from style LoRAs:
1. Load your style LoRA as "LoRA A" 
2. Load a character/face LoRA as "LoRA B"
3. Set strength B to ~0.7 (85% of normal usage)
4. Output a clean style LoRA that won't change faces

### Character Costume Extraction
- **Gandalf costume, no Ian McKellen face**: Mute facial layers (7,12,16,20)

### Cross-Tool LoRA Compatibility
Fix LoRAs that won't merge due to different training tools:
1. **Auto-detection**: Tool automatically detects and fixes metadata issues
2. **Manual fixes**: Use LoRA MetaEditor to fix network modules manually
3. **Mixed dimensions**: Layer-merged LoRAs automatically trigger concat mode
4. **Universal merging**: Combine LoRAs from AI-Toolkit, FluxGym, sd-scripts seamlessly

### Metadata Repair & Customization
Use the LoRA MetaEditor for advanced metadata management:
1. **Fix training tool bugs**: Correct wrong network modules or base model info
2. **Add missing information**: Training details, base model versions, custom tags
3. **Remove sensitive data**: Clean out unwanted metadata fields
4. **Standardize collections**: Ensure consistent metadata across your LoRA library

‚ö†Ô∏è **MetaEditor Safety**: Always backup your LoRAs before editing metadata. Incorrect changes can break your LoRAs permanently.
- **Wonder Woman outfit, no Gal Gadot face**: Use layer targeting
- **Anime character clothes, no specific face**: Create universal character LoRAs

### Advanced Combinations
- Mix facial features from one LoRA with style from another using layer-based merging
- Create hybrid concepts using selective layers
- Rescue partially corrupted or overtrained LoRAs

## üìä FLUX Layer Architecture

LoRA the Explorer works with FLUX's layer architecture:
- **Text Encoder (0-11)**: 12 layers
- **Double Blocks (0-19)**: 20 layers  
- **Single Blocks (0-37)**: 38 layers

**Known layer functions:**
- **Layers 7 & 20**: Primary facial structure and details
- **Layers 12 & 16**: Secondary facial features
- **Other layers**: Style, composition, lighting (experimental)

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Subtraction Sweet Spot
```
Optimal_Subtraction_Strength = Normal_Usage_Strength √ó 0.85
```

### Layer Targeting Strategy
- Start with preset combinations (facial, style, aggressive)
- Experiment with individual layers for fine control
- Use preview to see selected layers before applying

## üôè Credits & Dependencies

### sd-scripts Integration
LoRA the Explorer relies on [sd-scripts by kohya-ss](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts) for the core LoRA processing functionality. Our installer automatically downloads the sd3 branch which includes FLUX support.

**sd-scripts provides:**
- FLUX LoRA manipulation capabilities
- SafeTensors file handling
- Core mathematical operations for LoRA algebra

Special thanks to kohya-ss and the sd-scripts community for creating and maintaining this essential toolkit.

## üî¨ Technical Notes

### Mathematical Foundation
LoRAs modify model weights as: `W_new = W_original + Œ±(BA)`

Subtraction operation: `LoRA_A - LoRA_B = A‚ÇÅB‚ÇÅ - A‚ÇÇB‚ÇÇ`

This removes overlapping parameter modifications while preserving unique characteristics.

### Performance
- **Processing Speed**: ~2-5 seconds per operation
- **Memory Usage**: ~2GB RAM for large LoRAs
- **Compatibility**: Works with safetensors, ckpt, and pt formats
- **Quality**: No degradation when using optimal parameters
